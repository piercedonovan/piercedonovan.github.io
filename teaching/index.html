  <h1>Teaching</h1>

  
  <div class="article-style" itemprop="articleBody">

<hr />

<p>Below are summaries of the courses I&rsquo;m always working to improve. Please reach out if you&rsquo;d like to learn more about the courses or my teaching style. I design all of my materials myself&mdash;some sample materials for each course are available by request.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="environmental-and-natural-resource-economics">Environmental and Natural Resource Economics</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think we can properly address problems concerning the environment <em>without</em> economics. Economics is a discipline focused on smartly allocating scarce resources, and this applies to natural resources, too. Understanding the economic principles behind resource use&mdash;i.e. the incentives that motivate individual behavior&mdash;provides a framework for evaluating trade-offs between competing values and identifying policy solutions that improve societal welfare.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the <a href="/files/teaching/ECON_228_syllabus.pdf" target="_blank">syllabus and course outline</a> for a general-interest environmental economics course at Colgate that focuses on applying the principles of economics to environmental policy. This is a reading and writing-intensive course that emphasizes being able to convey economic intuition to policymakers. The raw review files from my most recent environmental econ course can be found here: (<a href="/files/teaching/ECON_228_spring_21_evals.pdf" target="_blank">evals</a>).</p>

<p>My upper-division natural resource economics course focuses on acquiring skills in mathematical modeling and computational methods in order to make a quantitative contribution to the environmental policy discussion. Here&rsquo;s the <a href="/files/teaching/ECON_383_syllabus.pdf" target="_blank">syllabus and course outline</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="statistics">Statistics</h2>

<p>I wish I had found statistics sooner. The course I teach at Colgate takes a &ldquo;story-telling&rdquo; approach, opting to emulate some of the lessons I&rsquo;ve learned by playing with data, reading the work of creative econometricians, and watching content creators (like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A" target="_blank">Numberphile</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw" target="_blank">3blue1brown</a>). I begin each class with phenomena worth investigating and work backwards to build up the tools that students need to examine it. No one wants to start with a definition of a t-test and <em>then</em> learn what it&rsquo;s for. Here&rsquo;s the <a href="/files/teaching/CORE_143S_syllabus.pdf" target="_blank">syllabus and course outline</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="econometrics">Econometrics</h2>

<p>Like with many modern variants of econometics, the development of my course was influenced by Angrist and Pischke&rsquo;s <em>Through Our Classes, Darkly</em> (<a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w23144.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>). I focus on the clear, careful thinking needed for the identification of causal effects and showcase modern econometric work through replication. Here&rsquo;s the <a href="/files/teaching/ECON_375_syllabus.pdf" target="_blank">syllabus and course outline</a>. This course is featured on the <em>Mastering &lsquo;Metrics</em> (Angrist and Pischke, 2014) <a href="http://masteringmetrics.com/sample-page/instructors-corner" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

<p>As there has been a recent drive to formalize causal identification logic, there are even more resources available now, compared to when I started teaching econometrics a few years ago. I&rsquo;m currently integrating elements of <a href="https://mixtape.scunning.com/" target="_blank"><em>Causal Inference: The Mixtape</em></a> (Scott Cunningham, 2021) into my class. I think this book is a great complement to <em>Mastering &lsquo;Metrics</em>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="mathematical-computational-methods-in-economics">Mathematical/Computational Methods [in economics]</h2>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t actually taught this one yet, but I have a pretty large folder on my computer full of potential lessons and possible directions for a course that could cover different strategies in economic modeling or numerical analysis. I&rsquo;d like to one day provide students with a comprehensive tour of the lesser-used techniques available to economists. This could make a great educational complement to a modern econometrics course.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="selected-student-comments">Selected student comments</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been collecting the following comments on a bunch of sticky notes over the past few years. These mean a lot to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Your enthusiasm and effort did not go unnoticed, your energy bled into the class. I have never been in a classroom where everyone was fully engaged like we were for your class. Usually, you have some people that don&rsquo;t care, screw around, or simply don&rsquo;t try. I felt like I was challenged to compete, to do better at all times. I feel like you went toe to toe all 12 rounds, no knockout. You never seemed burnt out or frustrated or overwhelmed. You have my highest ratings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You truly cared for this class; you answered emails at almost any times of the day, were willing to set up office hours/review times and always opened the floor for discussion. You made what is the hardest class in the major easy to understand and albeit, a little enjoyable. Seldom have I taken a class where I felt like the instructor cared, but you really did. I also felt like I learned a lot from this class, normally I just take notes and try to pass the tests, but I felt compelled to learn the material because you were so passionate in teaching it and getting us to understand the concepts. I don&rsquo;t know if you plan on being a professor, but if you do become one students will be lucky to have you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;[I appreciate] your focus on concept and intuition on teaching. This is the most difference between young teacher with old. When I took past class with senior professors. I think in their lectures, they don&rsquo;t always focus on definition, concepts. But you are totally different. From your lecture, homework, exams, you are always emphasizing concepts. I like this way you do. Although your class is difficult, I really can learn knowledges fundamentally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pierce went beyond the required amount of effort to explain the complex concepts of this class, which was very helpful and educational for students who are looking for more in-depth knowledge of the subject. You could tell he was enthusiastic about the material, and he&rsquo;s put a lot of thought into explaining concepts in a concise and easy to understand manner. He really wanted to help all of us succeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid to take econometrics, this was my last class before I graduated. And it was the class that made me feel like an economist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not only did I learn a lot from the class, but it gave me the confidence and economic intuition I had been lacking up until that point to succeed in further classes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pierce always understood our struggle and confusion.&rdquo;</p>
