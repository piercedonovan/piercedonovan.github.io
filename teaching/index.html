  <h1>Teaching</h1>

  
  <div class="article-style" itemprop="articleBody">

<hr />

<p>I read <em>Surely You&rsquo;re Joking</em>, (Feynman, 1985) as a freshman physics major, and when making this site I  remembered that [over-used] line about how teaching invites us to go back to things we think we know very well and wonder if there may be a better way to look at them. That changed my definition of &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; throughout undergrad and grad school; I feel like I spent most of my time thinking up marginally better ways to explain ideas (and constantly trying them out on peers and parents). In a formal teaching environment, I look forward to the satisfaction and understanding each new lap of ``Natural Resource Economics&rdquo; brings. Below are some of the courses I&rsquo;m continually developing.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="environmental-and-natural-resource-economics">Environmental and Natural Resource Economics</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think we can actually understand how to properly manage the environment <em>without</em> economics. Economics is a discipline focused on allocating scarce resources. It provides a framework for making trade-offs between competing values, like conservation and commerce. These trade-offs help identify policy solutions for many problems, among them being natural resource management.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a copy of the <a href="/files/teaching/donovan_ECON228_syllabus.pdf" target="_blank">syllabus and course outline</a> for a general-interest environmental economics class at Colgate that focuses on the intuition behind the economics that drives environmental policy. I plan to prepare an upper-division natural resource economics course for the Spring that is directed towards those strong in math who want an introduction to different models in resource economics.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="statistics">Statistics</h2>

<p>I wish I had found statistics sooner. The class I teach at Colgate takes an applied approach, opting to emulate some of the lessons I&rsquo;ve learned by playing with data, reading the work of creative econometricians, and watching high-quality content creators (like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A" target="_blank">Numberphile</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw" target="_blank">3blue1brown</a>). I begin each class with phenomena worth investigating and work backwards to build up the tools the class needs to examine it. No one <em>wants</em> to start with a t-test and then learn what it&rsquo;s for. Here&rsquo;s the <a href="/files/teaching/donovan_CORE143_syllabus.pdf" target="_blank">syllabus and course outline</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="econometrics">Econometrics</h2>

<p>At UC Davis, I taught an upper-division applied econometrics class. The development of the class was influenced by Angrist and Pischke&rsquo;s <em>Through Our Classes, Darkly</em> (<a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w23144.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>). I focused on the clear, careful thinking requisite for identification of causal effects and showcased modern econometric work to meet the interests of the Managerial Economics students (which were significantly different than the interests of my [mostly engineering] peers at RIT where I first encountered a very different econometrics).</p>

<p>My course is featured on the <em>Mastering &lsquo;Metrics</em> (Angrist and Pischke, 2014) <a href="http://masteringmetrics.com/sample-page/instructors-corner" target="_blank">website</a>. For a look at that class, here&rsquo;s the <a href="/files/teaching/donovan_ARE106_syllabus.pdf" target="_blank">syllabus and course outline</a>. Other sample materials are available by request.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="mathematical-computational-methods-in-economics">Mathematical/Computational Methods [in economics]</h2>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t actually taught this one yet, but I have a pretty large folder on my computer full of potential lessons and possible directions for a class that could cover different strategies in economic modeling or numerical analysis. I&rsquo;d like to one day provide students with a comprehensive tour of the lesser-used techniques available to economists. This could make a great educational complement to a modern econometrics class.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="selected-student-comments">Selected student comments</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been collecting the following comments on a bunch of sticky notes over the past few years. These mean a lot to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Your enthusiasm and effort did not go unnoticed, your energy bled into the class. I have never been in a classroom where everyone was fully engaged like we were for your class. Usually, you have some people that don&rsquo;t care, screw around, or simply don&rsquo;t try. I felt like I was challenged to compete, to do better at all times. I feel like you went toe to toe all 12 rounds, no knockout. You never seemed burnt out or frustrated or overwhelmed. You have my highest ratings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You truly cared for this class; you answered emails at almost any times of the day, were willing to set up office hours/review times and always opened the floor for discussion. You made what is the hardest class in the major easy to understand and albeit, a little enjoyable. Seldom have I taken a class where I felt like the instructor cared, but you really did. I also felt like I learned a lot from this class, normally I just take notes and try to pass the tests, but I felt compelled to learn the material because you were so passionate in teaching it and getting us to understand the concepts. I don&rsquo;t know if you plan on being a professor, but if you do become one students will be lucky to have you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;[I appreciate] your focus on concept and intuition on teaching. This is the most difference between young teacher with old. When I took past class with senior professors. I think in their lectures, they don&rsquo;t always focus on definition, concepts. But you are totally different. From your lecture, homework, exams, you are always emphasizing concepts. I like this way you do. Although your class is difficult, I really can learn knowledges fundamentally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pierce went beyond the required amount of effort to explain the complex concepts of this class, which was very helpful and educational for students who are looking for more in-depth knowledge of the subject. You could tell he was enthusiastic about the material, and he&rsquo;s put a lot of thought into explaining concepts in a concise and easy to understand manner. He really wanted to help all of us succeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid to take econometrics, this was my last class before I graduated. And it was the class that made me feel like an economist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not only did I learn a lot from the class, but it gave me the confidence and economic intuition I had been lacking up until that point to succeed in further classes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pierce always understood our struggle and confusion.&rdquo;</p>
